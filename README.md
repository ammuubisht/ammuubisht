### Hey! I'm Amit Bisht ðŸ‘‹

I started out coding in Python, mainly working on cool stuff in machine learning while being in AdTech Domain during my intern period. 
But now, My work responsibilities includes JavaScript too!

I'm pretty good at it, especially with Node.js and React.js. I also know my way around Django, Linux, Docker, MongoDB, and SQL.

By the way, I'm also an avid reader.
